      Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical
          Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but grew
          so different from Greek buildings as to become a new architectural
          style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical
          architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and
          even more so under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving
          buildings were constructed. It used new materials, particularly
          concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to
          make buildings that were typically strong and well-engineered. Large
          numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete
          and still in use.

      The architecture of ancient Greece is the architecture produced by
          the Greek-speaking people (Hellenic people) whose culture flourished
          on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in
          colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until
          the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works
          dating from around 600 BC.[1] Ancient Greek architecture is best
          known from its temples, many of which are found throughout the region,
          mostly as ruins but many substantially intact. The second important
          type of building that survives all over the Hellenic world is the
          open-air theatre, with the earliest dating from around 525-480 BC.

      Indian architecture is as old as the history of the civilization.The
          earliest remains of recognizable building activity in the India dates
          back to the Indus Valley cities. Among India's ancient architectural
          remains, the most characteristic are the temples, Chaityas, Viharas,
          Stupas and other religious structures. In ancient India, temple
          architecture of high standard developed in almost all regions. The
          distinct architectural style of temple construction in different
          parts was a result of geographical, climatic, ethnic, racial,
          historical and linguistic diversities. The Rock-cut structures present
          the most spectacular piece of ancient Indian art specimen. Most of
          the rock-cut structures were related to various religious communities.
